    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The ingredients in this easy wrap can be altered to your personal
      preference. Use your grill to make this into an easy summertime treat. In
      the winter, your oven will work just fine. The finished product will taste
      like something you'd order at a full service restaurant... but you'll be
      enjoying it in your own home!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>¼ cup sun-dried tomato dressing</li>
      <li>8 sun-dried tomatoes (not oil packed)</li>
      <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
      <li>⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
      <li>4 cups loosely packed torn fresh spinach</li>
      <li>4 (10 inch) whole wheat tortillas</li>
      <li>¼ cup sun-dried tomato dressing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large resealable plastic bag, combine chicken breasts and 1/4 cup
        dressing. Seal, and refrigerate for several hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat grill for high heat. Combine sun-dried tomatoes and hot water in
        a small bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes, drain, and cut tomatoes into
        thin slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil grill grate. Discard marinade, and place chicken on grill.
        Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut chicken into strips, and place in a medium bowl with sliced
        tomatoes, feta, and spinach. Toss with remaining 1/4 cup dressing.
        Distribute mixture between the four tortillas, and wrap. Either cut in
        half and enjoy cold, or place briefly back on grill until the tortilla
        turns warm and crispy.
