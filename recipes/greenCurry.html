    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a green curry recipe I've cobbled together over the years. The
      vegetables aren't completely traditional, but they give the whole thing a
      good texture and variety. Often asked for in my household, hopefully it'll
      become a favorite in yours. Serve over rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup Thai green curry paste</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (1/4 inch thick) slice ginger, finely grated</li>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can baby corn pieces, drained</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained</li>
      <li>2 (13.5 ounce) cans coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons palm sugar</li>
      <li>6 makrut lime leaves</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>1 orange bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>¼ cup thinly sliced Thai basil, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a wok until it starts to shimmer. Add curry paste, garlic,
        and ginger; stir together and fry until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
        chicken breast slices, stirring until coated. Cook until just slightly
        pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While chicken is cooking, place baby corn and bamboo shots in a small
        saucepan, cover with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil.
        Drain then cover with water again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour coconut milk into the wok. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring
        occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain corn and bamboo shoots and add in.
        Stir in fish sauce, palm sugar, and lime leaves. Bring back up to a
        simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in bell pepper strips and cook until
        crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove curry from heat and stir in Thai basil.</li>
    </ol>
